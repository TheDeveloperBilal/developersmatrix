## Task ID: 7 — Sprint 3: Deep Audit Checks
### Agent: Super Z (Main)
### Task: Add conversion optimization & advanced technical SEO audit modules

**Work Log:**

- **New `conversion-audit.ts` module** (28 deep checks):
  - CTA depth analysis: count, placement, text quality (weak words), above-fold visibility
  - Trust signals deep scan: privacy policy, terms, contact info, security badges, about us
  - Social proof detection: testimonials, client logos, user counts, case studies, awards
  - Form conversion optimization: field count friction, missing labels, validation indicators
  - Value proposition clarity: hero headline quality, benefit-focused language, pricing visibility
  - FOMO/urgency detection: countdowns, limited availability, scarcity messaging
  - Navigation conversion: excessive nav items, sparse footer links
  - Landing page structure: feature/benefit sections, FAQ presence, final CTA before footer
  - Mobile conversion: sticky CTA bar, small tap targets

- **New `technical-audit.ts` module** (32 deep checks):
  - robots.txt deep parse: wildcard UA, sitemap refs, disallow conflicts, broad rules, crawl-delay
  - XML sitemap validation: coverage, index handling, URL count limits
  - hreflang detection & validation: x-default fallback, self-referencing, invalid ISO codes
  - Canonical chain analysis: multiple tags, cross-domain, HTTP on HTTPS, invalid URLs
  - Redirect chain detection: 3xx pages, HTTP→HTTPS hops, 404s discovered in crawl
  - Internal linking structure: orphan pages, low-link pages, excessive outgoing links
  - Pagination handling: rel=next/prev, infinite scroll without proper SEO implementation
  - Duplicate content detection: duplicate titles, duplicate meta descriptions, near-duplicate text
  - URL parameter analysis: session IDs (PHPSESSID, JSESSIONID), UTM codes, filter params
  - HTTP status code analysis: 5xx server errors, slow TTFB (>3s)
  - Structured data validation: Organization, Article, Product schema required fields
  - Link depth analysis: pages >4 directory levels deep, URLs >100 characters

- **Engine integration**: Both modules wired into audit flow with progress tracking
- **Score updates**: Technical SEO gets its own score category; conversion replaces inline calc
- **UI updates**: WebsiteAuditClient.tsx now displays Technical SEO score card
- **Build verified**: 64 routes generated, exit code 0

**Commit**: `128e3d2` pushed to `preview` branch

**Stage Summary:**
- Website audit now runs 8 modules: SEO, Technical SEO, Performance, Mobile, Security, Accessibility, Content, Conversion
- Total checks increased from ~200 to ~260+
- All issues include: affected URLs, fix instructions, time-to-fix estimates, difficulty ratings, estimated impact percentages
- Ready for Vercel preview deployment
